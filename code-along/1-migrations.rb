# This is a Rails app and we want to load all the files in the app 
# when running this code.  To do so, your current working directory
# should be the top-level directory (i.e. /workspace/your-app/) and then run:
# rails runner code-along-complete/1-migrations.rb

# ------------------------------------------------
# Note: no code is needed in this file.
# Execute steps below in terminal and other files.
# ------------------------------------------------

# - Add model and table for the Company entity in our domain model

# 1. in terminal, generate the model and table for Company
# rails generate model _____
#    rails generate model Company
# 2. open newly generated files
# create db/...
# create app/..
# 3. in the db/migrate file, add relevant columns matching our domain model
# t.string "name" 
# etc

# 4. in terminal, execute the migration file
# rails db:migrate
#ORM gives it a primary key since it is a best practice
